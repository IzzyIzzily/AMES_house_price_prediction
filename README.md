# AMES_house_price_prediction

This project was to predict house salesprice in Ames US given 81 variables.The challenge was feature engineering, involving noise removal, missing value computing, data type tranformation. 
The project inspected performance of Lasso, Ridge, and SVR models. The results were compared by corresponding residual randomness and distribution. 
It further investigated the upgradable house characters in explaining the previous model residuals.
